Open the application and press "Update" to draw a red rectangle on the screen.

Adjust the width and height values of the rectangle, and the position (X and Y) values, to line it up with your map in a way you like. Press "Update" to redraw the rectangle with your changes.

When you have it lined up nicely, save your settings to avoiding having to line everything up again next time.

Finally, press the "Map" button in the topbar to switch to the map view. Resize that window and position as you like.

## Tips

If you plan on running the map window fully maximized, and your monitor uses a 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080, 2560x1440) then you should set your rectangle size as close to 16:9 as possible otherwise you will have stretching. I am using 510x250 which is closer to 18:9 so there is stretching but whatever.
